  Citizenship can define identity?    
</p>
<ul>    
 <li>
  Citizenship can define identity since the knowledge that your country is protecting you can give people a sense of belonging. 
 </li> 
 <li> 
  Citizenship can also give us a sense of identity if the person has pride in their country.
 </li>  
 <li>
  On the other hand there are many meanings of citizenship as the journal of case studies in education explains, “ In other words, different perspectives on citizenship define different perspectives on citizenship and define different relationships between citizenship and identity.” A bad experience with your country can give a sense of loss in identity.
