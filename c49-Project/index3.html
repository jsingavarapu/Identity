The influence of goals on identity  
</p>
<ul>    
 <li>
  Goals will influence the identity of people as shown by the PMC. The PMC explains an experiment in which the subject had a goal of eating healthy. If the subject chose to eat the cake this would be a result of monetary incentive. 
 </li> 
 <li> 
  If the subject chose to eat salad then this would be the result of social values and perceived effort. 
 </li>  
 <li>
  However both of these choices would result in the subjects identity changed as the PMC explains, “Identity, among other factors, contributes to the subjective value of goal consistent behaviours to the extent that the goal is identity-relevant.” 
 </li>
</ul>

<h1>Do talents affect your Identity?</h1>

<ul>
 <li>
  While at first thought talents and goals seem one and the same they in fact are very different. While goals focus on a weakness that you are trying to strengthen, talents are strengths that you have finally got to or were born with.     
 </li> 
 <li>
  Talents define your identity less than goals would since goals are still a work in progress and therefore define your identity more. Talents however show mastery of a skill. 
 </li> 
 <li>
  Using the previous example used in the goals category we can see how if we have a talent in eating healthy food we would be very likely to eat the salad instead of the cake.

Further investigation leads you to his family who speak of the kids talents and goals. Many of these goals and talents were on survival skills. Was the child kidnapped or did he escape on his own? Was the cause of this a result of monetery incentive or percived effort. </p>
